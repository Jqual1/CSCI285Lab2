    Description:
      Abstract: Mineral compositions are reported for Quaternary volcanic rocks of the Matan volcanic center, northern Harrat Rahat, Saudi Arabia.  Compositions were measured by wavelength-dispersive methods with the 5-spectrometer JEOL-8900 electron microprobe at the USGS facility in Menlo Park, California; background-corrected X-ray intensities were reduced to oxide weight concentrations with the JEOL proprietary version of the CITZAF reduction schema.  These results are part of a collaborative study by the U.S. Geological Survey and Saudi Geological survey to assess the volcanic and seismic hazards associated with the northern Harrat Rahat volcanic field.
      Purpose: The data were collected to determine composition of mineral phases of Quaternary volcanic rocks of northern Harrat Rahat, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. These compositions help to understand the origin and compositional evolution of volcanic rocks within northern Harrat Rahat.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description: Thin sections (30 micrometers thick) were prepared commercially and loaded into the 5-spectrometer JEOL-8900 electron-microprobe at the USGS facility in Menlo Park, California. All analyses were made with a 15 kilovolt accelerating voltage and the specific conditions: for plagioclase, 10 nanoamperes Faraday current, 10 micrometer diameter beam; for spinels, 20 nanoamperes Faraday current, focused beam; for pyroxene and olivine, 15 nanoamperes Faraday current, focused beam. Count times were 30 seconds on peak and 10 seconds on + and - backgrounds for all elements except sodium, for which count times were 10 seconds on peak and 5 seconds on backgrounds. Sodium and potassium were measured first to minimize diffusive loss under the beam.  Background-corrected X-ray intensities were converted to concentrations with the JEOL proprietary version of the CITZAF reduction schema referenced to a selection of natural and synthetic mineral standards.  Interference of titanium K-beta on vanadium K-alpha X-rays was corrected by analysis of vanadium-free titanium dioxide to determine the apparent vanadium X-ray count rates proportional to titanium count rates and application of this correction to unknowns.
